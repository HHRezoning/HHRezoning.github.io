There is a [petition on change.org to stop the rezoning of Hidden Hills][petition].
As of this writing, they are at 1487 signatures and trying to get to 1500.
Let's help them get there!

   [petition]:  https://www.change.org/p/stop-the-rezoning-and-destruction-of-600-acres-of-woodland-agricultural-land-for-commercial-use

**Update:**  The petition has reached 1500 signatures (and counting)!
You can still sign though to show your disapproval of the rezoning.
Coming out to the [Planning Commission meeting](announcement) in person will have an even greater impact!

Also, it's important to note that if the Planning Commission approves the rezoning and PUD, the City Commission (equivalent to the city council) will need to approve the proposals at one of their meetings.
City Commission meetings are ususally scheduled for the first Monday of the month, but they can also call special meetings ([as they've done recently][meetings website]).
I've heard [rumors] that the City Commission may hold a special, early meeting to approve the rezoning and PUD, but I haven't been able to confirm if that's true or not.
If I get concrete information regarding future meetings, I will post what I find on this blog.

On a personal note, I'm frustrated that the city is not being more transparent with the scheduling of these meetings and the whole rezonining/PUD approval process.
It's difficult to tell what is official and what is not because the City of Collegedale makes this information difficult to find.
I _think_ that the traffic study that was commissioned was completed, but I haven't been able to find any information regarding it on the city's website.
You can find information about the meetings on the city's [meetings website], although it's not necessarily straight-forward to locate that webpage (or at least it wasn't for me).
Scheduled meetings are not, however, listed on the city's calendar, news feed, or displayed on any signage.
Just tonight I saw a notice on the big electronic sign in front of the library for local club meetings;
it's been quite some time since I've seen a similar notice for Planning Commission or City Commission meetings.

Finally, just to note, I'm **not** affiliated with [the Change.org petition][petition].
I just think it's important to show the city that this rezoning and PUD is not the direction that citizens want Collegedale moving in, and think the petition may be a helpful way of doing that.
Most importantly, **please plan on attending the [Planning Commission meeting on September 12th at 6:00 p.m.][announcement] to make your voice heard.**

**Edited:**  I removed any specific reference to future City Commission meeting dates because I haven't been able to confirm those dates.
I also tweaked the post a bit.
