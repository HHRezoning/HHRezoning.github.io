There is a [petition on change.org to stop the rezoning of Hidden Hills][petition].
As of this writing, they are at 1487 signatures and trying to get to 1500.
Let's help them get there!

Also, [according to updates from the petition creator][updates], if the zoning and PUD proposal pass on September 12th, the City Commission will hold a meeting one week afterwards, on September 19th, to give final approval to the rezoning and PUD.
(The City Commission is the legislative body of Collegedale, TN, similar to city councils in many other cities.)
I haven't been able to confirm this, as regular City Commission meetings are usually on the first Monday of the month, but it may be worthwhile to keep an eye on scheduled meetings, in case they try to expedite the process.
If I get concrete information regarding future meetings, I will post what I find on this blog.

On a personal note, I'm frustrated that the city is not being more transparent with the scheduling of these meetings.
I don't want to spread misinformation, but it's difficult to tell what is official and what is not because the City of Collegedale makes this information difficult to find.
You can find information about the meetings on the city's [meetings website], although it's not necessarily straight-forward to locate that webpage (or at least it wasn't for me).
Scheduled meetings are not, however, listed on the city's calendar, news feed, or displayed on any signage.
Just tonight I saw a notice on the big electronic sign in front of the library for the "Happy Hookers Yarn Club";
it's been quite some time since I've seen a similar notice for Planning Commission or City Commission meetings.

Finally, just to note, I am **not** affiliated with [the Change.org petition][petition].
I just think it's important to show the city that this rezoning and PUD is not the direction that citizens want Collegedale moving in, and think the petition may be a helpful way of doing that.
Most importantly, **please plan on attending the [Planning Commission meeting on September 12th at 6:00 p.m.][announcement] to make your voice heard.**
