title:    Agenda for Sept. 12th Planning Commission meeting
---

The City of Collegedale has the agenda for the [September 12th Planning Commission meeting](https://cms8.revize.com/revize/collegedaletn//Document%20Center/Agendas%20&%20Minutes/Planning%20Commission/2022/September%2012%20Agenda.pdf) on it's website.

Those interested in [past agendas and meeting minutes](https://www.collegedaletn.gov/government/agendas___minutes/planning_commission.php) can also find them on the City's website.
(I will add this link to the [general information](/info/) page as well.)

On a personal note, I'm glad to find the agenda for Monday's meeting on the City website, as there is no mention of the meeting on the [City calendar](https://www.collegedaletn.gov/calendar.php), which is completely empty.
(I'm not sure why these meetings aren't on the calendar, as in my opinion, they ought to be.)

Again, a reminder to come out to the meeting to make your voice heard concerning the Hidden Hills rezoning and PUD.
The meeting is this coming **Monday, September 12th at 6:00 p.m. at City Hall**.
If you know anyone who would be interested in attending, please let them know as well.
