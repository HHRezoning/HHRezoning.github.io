Some sad news everyone: despite all the opposition from the citizens who came out, the planning commission approved the rezoning and the PUD.
The process is not over however.
The city commission will need to give final approval to the plan at their next meeting on October 3rd, so there is still a chance to stop this from going through.

I will post more details later, but for now I need to take a bit of a break.

One quick tidbit: When Mike Price was asked by the planning commission if the woods behind the development would be made available to the general public, he said it would, but the City would need to front the money to install parking and build out the trails.
Wasn't this PUD partially sold on the idea that it would make those woods and green space available to the people of Collegedale?
And now they are trying to shift that responsibility to the city....
