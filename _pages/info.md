The Hidden Hills rezoning and planned unit development (PUD) is a proposal to add a 591 home subdivision to the outskirts of Collegedale, TN.
The proposed development would empty onto Edgemon Rd. and more than double the amount of homes that empty onto this 2 lane road.

The [Hidden Hills PUD proposal](https://cms8.revize.com/revize/collegedaletn//Document%20Center/Agendas%20&%20Minutes/Planning%20Commission/2022/PC%207-11-2022%20AgendaRev.pdf) is provided by the City, although it seems to be missing information that the Collegedale Zoning Ordinances require.

Previous Planning Commission meetings can be [viewed on the City of Collegedale's Youtube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJBkeSGGrkHD1D6Ws5m9eNg/videos).
The initial hearing was on [July 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toS4m6tmVnk) and the grant of extension to delay the next hearing to Sept. 12 was on [August 8, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=222TXP6FGX8).

You can find [Planning Commission meeting agendas and minutes](https://www.collegedaletn.gov/government/agendas___minutes/planning_commission.php) on the City's website.

The [Collegedale Zoning Ordinances](https://cms8.revize.com/revize/collegedaletn//Document%20Center/Department/Planning%20&%20Economic%20Development/CollegedaleZoningOrd_March2022.pdf) are also available from [the City's website](https://www.collegedaletn.gov/departments/planning___economic_development/zoning___subdivision_information.php).
The section concerning PUDs is 17.09, titled _Planned Residential Developments_, and contains many subsections.
R-1-L zoning (low density, single-family residential) is handled in chapter 5.
Note though that I have not had the chance to read the whole ordinance (it is over 200 pages long), nor am I qualified to give legal advice, so you will have to do your own research.
